Apartment
Your apartment is a cheery little box. On the east wall is a round window. A woven rug adorns the floor in the middle of the room. Along the west wall are a fridge and some shelves. A bed lies in the northwest corner, and a stove lies in the northeast.

On the stove is a frying pan.

On the shelves is a loaf of bread.

It circles lazily above you for a minute or two, then soars off elsewhere.
