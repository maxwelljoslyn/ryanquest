Part 1 - Grabbing

Understand "grab [something]" as taking.

Part 2 - Printing Directions

Understand the command "directions" as something new.

Directions is an action applying to nothing. Understand "directions" or "dirs" or "ways" as directions.

Check directions:
	do nothing.

Carry out directions:
	do nothing.

Report directions:
	if the location is the island:
		say "From here you can ride the eagle to return to the mainland.";
	else:
		repeat with that way running through directions:
			if the room that way from the location is a room:
				now that way is marked for listing;
		say "From here you can:";
		say line break;
		repeat with that way running through directions:
			if that way is marked for listing:
				let Q be the room that way from the location;
				say "- go [bold type][that way][roman type] to [the Q]";
				say line break;
		if the location is the path and the eagle is in the location:
			say "- ride the eagle to go to the island.";
			say line break;
		if the location is the train platform:
			say "- ride the C-Train to go to Copenhagen Metro Station.";
			say line break;
		if the location is the metro station:
			say "- ride the C-Train to go to the Hellerup Train Platform.";
			say line break;
		now every direction is not marked for listing.

Part 3 - Goto Room

Understand "travel [any room]" or "travel to [any room]" or "go [any room]" or "go to [any room]" as a mistake ("Unfortunately, you must travel room-by-room. The implementation of commands to directly travel to a known room caused bugs with plot event timing, and this game was hard enough to get working as it is.")

[
[It was good that I tried this out, but the fact that the player gets moved from one room to another instantly (and without any of the normal restraints on movement) can cause problems - for example, going inside the belly of the tree without being high, or traveling to the island without riding the eagle. Thus, I will not put these commands in the game.]

Understand the command "travel" as something new.

Traveling is an action applying to one thing. Understand "travel [any room]" or "travel to [any room]" or "go [any room]" or "go to [any room]" as traveling.

Check traveling:
	if the noun is not visited, say "You can only fast-travel to places you've already been." instead;
	if the noun is limbo, say "'Limbo' is not part of the game world." instead;
	if the noun is the fake tree, try traveling the belly of the tree instead; [bad]
	if the noun is not a room, say "Use 'travel' or 'go to' with the name of a room." instead.

Carry out traveling:
	say "You go to [the noun].";
	now the player is in the noun.

Report traveling:
	do nothing.]


Part 4 - Money

Price is a kind of value. 10 kroner specifies a price. A thing has a price. The price of a thing is usually 0 kroner. After examining something for sale which is not the money, say "It costs [the price of the noun]."

Definition: a thing is free if the price of it is 0 kroner.
Definition: a thing is for sale if it is not free.

Instead of taking something for sale which is not the money:
	say "That costs money."

Before buying something for sale when the player does not enclose the money:
	say "You don't have any money." instead.
	
Before buying something for sale when the money is free:
	say "You don't have any money." instead.
	
Before buying something for sale when the price of the money is less than the price of the noun:
	say "You don't have enough money for [the noun]." instead.
	
Instead of buying something:
	decrease the price of the money by the price of the noun;
	say "You pay [the price of the noun] for [the noun], leaving yourself with [the price of the money].";
	if the money is free:
		now the money is in Limbo;
	now the price of the noun is 0 kroner;
	now the player is carrying the noun.


The player carries a wallet. The description of the wallet is "You picked this bad boy up in Italy. It's a genuine Silvatorio Mossaganezza." The wallet contains money. The price of the money is 2 kroner. The printed name of the money is "money totalling [if the price of the money is 1 kroner]1 krone[else][price of the money][end if]". Understand "cash" or "dosh" as the money. The description of the money is "[The price of the money] will go further than you expect.".

The wallet contains 1 Uncle Sam. The description of the Uncle Sam is "The hardest currency on Earth."

After examining the Uncle Sam for the first time:
	say "A single tear leaks out as you contemplate the majesty of the USD.".

Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.

Instead of buying something free:
	say "That doesn't cost any money.";
	try silently taking the noun.

Instead of buying the money:
	say "The money belongs to you, and you buy things with it."

Instead of taking the money when the player does not enclose the money:
	now the money is in the wallet;
	say "Taken."

Instead of dropping the money:
	say "What are you, a commie drongo? Hang onto that cash!"

The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules.

The block kissing rule is not listed in the check kissing rulebook.

A woman called Ana is in the IIT Campus. The description of Ana is "A Czech girl in a white dress. Starting next week, she's your TA for Introductory Programming. Starting last night, she's your lover."

Ana is proper-named. Ana is wearing a white dress. The description of the dress is "It looks good on her."

A person can be mad or happy. A person is usually happy. Ana is mad.

Instead of taking a person:
	say "You can't take a living thing!".

Report Ana rejecting conversation when Ana is mad:
	say "Ana tosses her hair and refuses to answer.".

Report Ana rejecting conversation when Ana is not mad:

After showing something (called the thingy) to Ana:
	say "She smiles at you and brushes [the thingy] with her hand."

Instead of taking Ana when Ana is touchable and Ana is mad:
	[this statement stems from a bug. originally I used the word 'named' to initialize Ana, but the actual keyword for that is 'called'. 'named' gave me a thing instead of a person, and I had to debug for a while to figure it out. ('named' seemed so natural for a person that I overlooked it.) while debugging I used this code to help me diagnose. I decided to leave it in as a hidden gag.]
	say "Ana is incensed. 'Trying to take me in in public?! What would your [one of]glorious[or]precious[or]exalted[at random] [one of]Washington[or]Jefferson[or]Lincoln[or]Roosevelt[or]Kennedy[at random] think of that?'".

After kissing Ana:
	say "You plant your [lippy] lips on her [one of]cheek[or]forehead[or]nose[then at random], and she [one of]squeals[or]wiggles[purely at random] in delight."

To say buy-tater:
	say "Try making a purchase with the 'buy' command instead, e.g. 'buy potato'."

Before giving something (called the gift) to someone (called the taker):
	if the gift is the money, say "[buy-tater]" instead;
	if the taker is a merchant, say "[buy-tater]" instead; [THIS is the line that makes trigges when people try to GIVE things to a merchant and causeds nonsensical dialogue. todo fixme - take this out and write custom logic for the merchants instead - perhaps a custom action can be used.]
	if the taker is a bird, try feeding the gift to the taker instead;
	if the taker is not Ana, say "[The second noun] [do not] desire [the gift]." instead.

Part 7 - Bald Eagle

Include Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson.

A bird is a kind of rideable animal.

Instead of kissing a bird:
        say "[The noun] shies away from your [lippy] lips.".

To say lippy:
	let Z be {"quivering", "parted", "soft", "searching"};
	sort Z in random order;

Limbo is a room. In Limbo is a bird called the bald eagle. Understand "bird" as the bald eagle.

In Limbo is a bird called the friendly bird.

Instead of mounting the friendly bird:
	say "Good instincts . . . but [the noun] [are] will need to be even friendlier for that."

Instead of mounting the wretched bird:
	say "[The noun] is too weak and sickly to ride."

The description of the bald eagle is "Its plumage feathers are a rich brown, edged with a color that can only be called the Gold Standard. Its head is the same shade as the White House itself."

The description of the friendly bird is "This is the bird you fed earlier. It seems to have regained some energy after eating: [one of]its plumage has a healthy sheen[or]it clucks happily to itself[or]it preens and struts about[then at random]."

Understand the command "feed" as something new.

Feeding it to is an action applying to one carried thing and one thing.

Understand "feed [something] to [something]" as feeding it to. Understand "feed [someone] [something]" as feeding it to (with nouns reversed).

Check feeding something (called the food) to something (called the eater):
	if the eater is not a person, say "You can't feed an inanimate object!" instead;
	if the eater is not a bird, say "[The eater] [are] not willing to be fed by [us]." instead;
	if the eater is the bald eagle, say "[The eater] [are] is free from all desire." instead;
	if the printed name of the food matches the text "panties", say "Unlike [us], [the eater] [are] entirely unmotivated by sexy underwear." instead;
	let Q be {steak, Uncle Sam};
	if the eater is the wretched bird and the food is listed in Q:
		say "[A food] is much too good for [the eater]." instead;
	let L be {pile of herring, mound of herring, steak, Uncle Sam};
	if the food is not listed in L:
		say "[The eater] turns its head away from [the food]." instead.

Carry out feeding something (called the food) to something (called the eater):
	now the food is nowhere;
	if the eater is the wretched bird:
		now the wretched bird is nowhere;
		now the friendly bird is in the cemetery;
		increase the score by 1;
	else if the eater is the friendly bird and the location is the cemetery:
		now the friendly bird is nowhere;
		now the bald eagle is on the gnarled bush;
		increase the score by 2.

Report feeding something (called the food) to something (called the eater):
	if the eater is the wretched bird:
		say "[The eater] regards you warily, then opens its beak and snaps up [the food]. It swallows in one gulp.";
		say line break;	
		say "You see a flash of brilliance in its black, beady eyes. Then it caws, and flies off in the direction of Copenhagen.";
		say line break;
		say "You feel strangely proud.";
	else if the eater is the friendly bird:
		say "[The eater] nuzzles your hand, then spears your offering with its beak. With a jerk of its head, [the food] disappears down the bird's gullet.";
		say line break;
		say "[The eater] shrieks in triumph. It ascends into the sky, until it is so far away that you can only perceive a black dot.";
		say line break;
		say "There is a flash of light so brilliant that you have to avert your eyes. When you look up again, the black dot has disappeared . . .".		
		

Has-ridden-from-path and has-ridden-from-island are truth states that vary.

When play begins:
	now has-ridden-from-path is false;
	now has-ridden-from-island is false.

Instead of mounting the bald eagle:
	if the location is the path:
		if has-ridden-from-path is false:
			now has-ridden-from-path is true;
			play the sound of eagle;
			say "The eagle shrieks, and dives off the promontory with you on its back. As you cling for dear life, it swoops down to skim the water, then soars out above the bay.[paragraph break]The view out here is breathtaking. Twisting your head around, you can look back and see all of Copenhagen laid out like breakfast.";
		else:
			play the sound of eagle;
			say "The eagle screams in the language of liberty, and carries you to the island.";
		say line break;
		now the eagle is in the island;
		now the player is in the island;
		stop the action;
	else:
		if has-ridden-from-island is false:
			play the sound of eagle;
			now has-ridden-from-island is true;
			say "The eagle jetplanes into the heavens with you on its back. After another harrowing ride over the bay, it deposits you neatly on the promontory.";
		else:
			play the sound of eagle;
			say "The eagle shrieks freedomishly, and carries you to the promontory.";
		now the eagle is on the gnarled bush;
		now the player is in the path.

Part 8 - Other Stuff

The carrying capacity of the player is 3. [One for the backpack and one for each hand.]

A merchant is a kind of person.

Part 9 - Food and Cooking

A food is a kind of thing. A food is usually edible. A food is usually portable.

The sanity-check rules are a rulebook.

This is the sanity-check stage rule:
    abide by the sanity-check rules.

The sanity-check stage rule is listed after the before stage rule in the action-processing rules.

To say fool:
	let X be "[dumb]" in title case;
	say "[X] American, have you truly mistaken [the noun] for food?"

To say dumb:
	say "[one of]foolish[or]stupid[or]idiotic[or]ignorant[or]troublesome[then at random]".

Sanity-check eating an inedible thing:
	if the noun is the steak:
		say "You'll have to cook it first." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "[fool]" instead.

Understand the command "cook" as something new.

Cooking is an action applying to one thing. Understand "cook [something]" as cooking. Understand "fry [something]" as cooking.

Check cooking something (called the munch):
	if the munch is not a food, say "[fool]" instead;
	if the frying pan is not touchable, say "You need a pan to cook in." instead;
	if the location is not the apartment, say "Your only place to cook is your apartment stove." instead.

Carry out cooking something for the first time:
	increase the score by 1;
	now the noun is edible.

Carry out cooking something:
	now the noun is edible.

Report cooking something (called the munch):
	say "[We] cook [the munch], filling the air with [one of]delicious[or]tasty[or]mouth-watering[or]delectable[then at random] smells.".

Before eating the steak:
	say "Are you sure? You might need that later. [bracket]y/n[close bracket] ";
	if the player consents:
		continue the action;
	otherwise:
		stop the action.
		
Part 10 - Exit List

To say exit list:
	let place be location;
	repeat with way running through directions:
		let place be the room way from the location;
		if place is a room, say " [way]".

Rule for printing the name of a direction (called the way) while constructing the status line:
	choose row with a heading of the way in the Table of Abbreviation;
	say "[shortcut entry]".

Table of Abbreviation
heading	shortcut
north	"N"
northeast	"NE"
northwest	"NW"
east	"E"
southeast	"SE"
south	"S"
southwest	"SW"
west	"W"
up	"U"
down	"D"
inside	"IN"
outside	"OUT"

Part 11 - Status Line

When play begins:
	now the left hand status line is "Loc: [the player's surroundings]. Dirs: [exit list]";
	now the right hand status line is "Points: [score]/[maximum score]".

Rule for printing the name of the hellerup apartment while constructing the status line: say "Apartment".
Rule for printing the name of the strandvejen while constructing the status line: say "Strandvejen".
Rule for printing the name of the main street while constructing the status line: say "Christiana".
Rule for printing the name of the train platform while constructing the status line: say "Platform".
Rule for printing the name of the metro station while constructing the status line: say "Metro".
Rule for printing the name of the commissary while constructing the status line: say "Commissary".

Part 12 - Speech and Conversation

Section 1 - Talking to People

Understand "talk to [someone]" as a mistake ("To speak with someone, try one of 'ask [bracket]someone[close bracket] about something' or 'ask [bracket]someone[close bracket] for something'.").

Asking someone about something is speech. Telling someone about something is speech. Answering someone that something is speech. Asking someone for something is speech.

Instead of telling someone about something:
	try asking the noun about it.

A person has a table name called conversation.

Instead of asking someone about something:
	let the source be the conversation of the noun;
	if topic understood is a topic listed in source:
		say "[reply entry][paragraph break]";
	otherwise:
		try the noun rejecting conversation.

Rejecting conversation is an action applying to nothing.

Check rejecting conversation:
	do nothing.

Carry out rejecting conversation:
	do nothing.

The conversation of the fisherman is the Table of Fisherman Conv.

Table of Fisherman Conv

"the/-- monk" or "[island]"	"The fisherman looks uncomfortable. 'I, uh, I've never heard of such a thing . . . wouldn't you like to buy some fish?'"	

Report the fisherman rejecting conversation:
	say "The [italic type]fisker[roman type] shifts from foot to foot. 'Reckon I don't know much about that.'"

Section 2 - Talking about Things

[copy the Nameless example]
[A thing can be known or unknown.

Understand "ask [someone] about [any known thing]" as interrogating it about. interrogating it about is an action applying to two visible things.
]

	say "It is the Year of Our Lord MMXVIII. You have arrived in the Danish city of Copenhagen to pursue a master's degree. You found an apartment for let in the suburb of Hellerup, and promptly moved in. The place isn't much, but for the next two years it's home.";
	say paragraph break;

Part 1 - Hellerup

Hellerup is a region.

Chapter 1 - Hellerup Apartment

The Hellerup Apartment is a room in Hellerup. "Your apartment is a cheery little cube. On the east wall is a round window. A woven rug adorns the floor in the middle of the room. Along the west wall are a fridge and some shelves. A bed lies in the northwest corner, and a stove lies in the northeast."

The player is in the apartment.

[Instead of exiting the apartment:
        try going south.]

The apartment door is a door. It is south of the Apartment and north of Hellerup Strandvejen. The description is "Just looking at this door makes you eager to start each day."

"[technique]"	"'The last possible technique? Yes, I know of it. [if the score is less than gotta-have]I cannot, per se, teach it to you, but I will show you the way forward . . . [italic type]if[roman type] you improve your score.' He points at the top right corner of the screen.[else]The contents of [thisthat] wooden box are your pathway toward the technique.'[end if]"
"the/-- [fisker]"	"'Ah yes, the one who supplies me with food. A pious man, he is.'"
