Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

>feed pile of herring to bird
(first taking the pile of herring)
The friendly bird nuzzles your hand, then spears your offering with its beak. With a jerk of its head, the pile of herring disappears down the bird's gullet.

The friendly bird shrieks in triumph. It ascends into the sky, until it is so far away that you can only perceive a black dot.

There is a flash of light so brilliant that you have to avert your eyes. When you look up again, the black dot has disappeared . . .

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!
