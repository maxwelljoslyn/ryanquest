The species is impossible to identify, but its plumage is wilted, its beak is crooked, and its eyes are dull.

Hellerup Strandvejen
The main street of Hellerup is bordered on its north side by brightly-painted row houses, such as the one containing your apartment. At the east end is a dock, and if you go west you can catch a train.

You can see an apartment door, a fisherman and a wheelbarrow (in which are a pile of herring and a mound of herring) here.

>get herring
Which do you mean, the fistful of herring, the pile of herring or the mound of herring?

>get fistful herring
That seems to belong to the fisherman.

>get mound of herring
That costs money.

>buy herring
Which do you mean, the fistful of herring, the pile of herring or the mound of herring?

>buy pile
You pay 1 kroner for the pile of herring, leaving yourself with 5 kroner.

>feed bird
You can't see any such thing.

>go dock
Unfortunately, you must travel room-by-room. The implementation of commands to directly travel to a known room caused bugs with plot event timing, and this game was hard enough to get working as it is.

Hellerup Apartment
Your apartment is a cheery little cube with its door to the south. On the east wall is a round window, and on the west wall are a fridge and some shelves. A bed sits in the northwest corner, the stove lies in the northeast, and a woven rug adorns the floor in the middle of the room.

On the stove is a frying pan.

On the shelves is a loaf of bread.

You can also see a dwarf banana tree, a fridge (in which is a steak) and the bed (on which are bedsheets and a pair of Central European panties) here.

The fisherman calls out, "Today I have a mound of herring! Very tasty!"

Train Platform
The open-air train platform has a line that runs to Copenhagen. There are no tickets: it is free to ride. In the northwest corner of the station stands the staircase that leads to the Commissary.

You can see a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever), a wall sign and an arrow-shaped sign here.

The Dock
This is a shabby little dock used for the fishing trade. At the end of the dock, a little rowboat, moored with a rope, bobs up and down. In the rowboat is a large crate, atop which sits a bird.

>feed bird
What do you want to feed the wretched bird?

>feed bird herring
