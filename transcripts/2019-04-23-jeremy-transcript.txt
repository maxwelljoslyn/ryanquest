This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!

Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.

Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.

You can see a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever) and the fake tree here.

The Path
This odd little path runs out of the metro station and terminates at a promontory overlooking the bay. The ground is grassy, but the only larger vegetation is a gnarled bush.

Out in the bay is a small island.

On the gnarled bush is the bald eagle.

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!

 You did your best
 You played the game

 You rode the train
 You sussed out spots

 And dank weed too
 You talked to folks

 Forever glad
 
 Eight times you pressed

 Haha, I say

 You made your way
 All on your own
 
 With eagle's help
 You met the monk
 You opened up

 Set your mind free
 You willed yourself

 You did the thing
 Good job to you
