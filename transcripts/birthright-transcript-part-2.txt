Island of Technique
This little island is no tropical paradise: it's foggy, muddy, and riddled with trees.

You can see the bald eagle and a monk here.

>look at monk
He stands solemnly, with his arms nearly enveloped by the sleeves of his robe. In one hand he carries a small wooden box.

>look at box
Plainer than a raw herring.

>ask monk about box
"The contents of this wooden box are your pathway toward the ultimate technique."

>look at eagle
Its plumage feathers are a rich brown, edged with a color that can only be called the Gold Standard. Its head is the same shade as the White House itself.

>ask monk about the ultimate technique
"The last possible technique? Yes, I know of it. The contents of this wooden box are your pathway toward the technique."

>ask monk for box
The monk hands you the wooden box.

As you take it in your hands, you feel a great weightiness upon your soul.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open box
You open the wooden box, revealing the ineffable mystery.

>look in box
In the wooden box is the ineffable mystery.

>take ineffable mystery
(putting the steak into the backpack to make room)
You're carrying too many things already.

>look in ineffable mystery
You find nothing of interest.

>look at ineffable mystery
Did you really think you could figure this one out just by looking?

>smoke joint
You hit it and don't quit it. Your War-on-Drugs work ethic erases that joint from existence.

Now you're baked.

Wow. You're totally baked.

>ask monk about ineffable mystery
"I cannot help you with that," says the monk.

You're super baked.

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!

>mount eagle
[Sound effect number 4 here.]
The eagle jetplanes into the heavens with you on its back. After another harrowing ride over the bay, it deposits you neatly on the promontory.

The Path
This odd little path runs out of the metro station and terminates at a promontory overlooking the bay. The ground is grassy, but the only larger vegetation is a gnarled bush.

Out in the bay is a small island.

On the gnarled bush is the bald eagle.

 You did your best
 You played the game
 You won the quest
 
 You fed the bird
 You rode the train
 You sussed out spots
 With points to gain
 
 You bought herring
 And dank weed too
 You talked to folks
 Much unlike you
 
 You made Ana

 Now she will be
 Forever glad
 
 Eight times you pressed
 The beige button
 Haha, I say
 That one was fun
 
 You relaxed in
 The graveyard zone
 You made your way
 All on your own
 
 With eagle's help
 You met the monk
 You opened up
 His wooden trunk
 
 The dank you smoked
 Set your mind free
 You willed yourself
 To enter tree
 
 You did the thing
 Good job to you
 Perhaps I'll make
