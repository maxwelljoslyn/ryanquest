Hellerup Apartment
Your apartment is a cheery little cube. On the east wall is a round window. A woven rug adorns the floor in the middle of the room. Along the west wall are a fridge and some shelves. A bed lies in the northwest corner, and a stove lies in the northeast.

On the stove is a frying pan.

On the shelves is a loaf of bread.

You can also see a backpack (empty), a dwarf banana tree, a fridge (closed) and the bed (on which are bedsheets and a pair of Central European panties) here.

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!

Hellerup Strandvejen
The main street of Hellerup is bordered on its north side by brightly-painted row houses, such as the one containing your apartment. At the east end is a dock, and if you go west you can catch a train.

The fisherman calls out, "Today I have a pile of herring and a mound of herring! Fresh!"

Train Platform
The open-air train platform has a line that runs to Copenhagen. There are no tickets: it is free to ride. A staircase and an arrow-shaped sign in the northwest corner of the station pair up to beckon you downward.

You can see a wall sign and a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever) here.

The lever is currently switched off.

With a tug of the lever, you are transported to Copenhagen proper.

Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award. A flight of stairs lead southward and upward to the IIT Campus exit, while going northwest will take you to Christiana. (Don't go there at night!) If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.

You can see a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever) and the fake tree here.

You step out of the train.

>look at fake tree
A huge plastic palm tree, fifteen feet tall and twenty feet around. It "grows" from an inch-thick disc of marble which is set into the floor of the station, disrupting the pattern of tiles around it.
