Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.

You can see a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever) and the fake tree here.

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").

Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.

You can see a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever) and the fake tree here.

>in
You examine the fake tree, but there's no way to get in.

Perhaps if you boosted your imagination you'd think of something.

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!

This little island is no tropical paradise: it's foggy, muddy, and riddled with trees.

"I cannot help you with that," says the monk.

The monk holds the wooden box out of your reach. Do you ask him for it?

Please answer yes or no.> yes

The monk hands you the wooden box.

As you take it in your hands, you feel a great weightiness upon your soul.

[Sound effect number 4 here.]
The eagle jetplanes into the heavens with you on its back. After another harrowing ride over the bay, it deposits you neatly on the promontory.

The Path
This odd little path runs out of the metro station and terminates at a promontory overlooking the bay. The ground is grassy, but the only larger vegetation is a gnarled bush.

Out in the bay is a small island.

On the gnarled bush are the bald eagle and bedsheets.

You can also see a steak here.

Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.
