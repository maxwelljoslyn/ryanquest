Copenhagen Metro Station
This is the main metro station in Copenhagen. Its creator won the Best Dane of the Year Award.

A flight of stairs which lead upward and southward to IIT Campus, where you begin your classes next week. Christiana lies northwest of here: don't go there at night! If you're feeling contemplative, the Danes have built an efficient route running west to the Aarenhus Cemetery.

A small door stands in the southeast corner of the station near a fake tree.

You can see a C-Train (in which are a wrap-around sofa and a lever) and the fake tree here.

This is a classic text-adventure game. You play by typing in what you want to do. If this is your first text adventure, I wish you luck, and leave you with these tips:

1) Take the time to "look" at everything, e.g. "look (at) cheese" or "examine rug". You'll experience more jokes and puzzles if you scrutinize the game world.
2) "Take" intriguing or suspicious objects with you for later. Your backpack will hold as many things as you like.
3) Refer to this table for some useful commands:
look      - l   - On its own, describes your immediate surroundings ("l"). For detailed descriptions, specify a direct object ("look backpack").
take      - N/A - Picks something up.
inventory - i   - Shows what you're carrying.
dirs      - N/A - Lists the directions you can go from here.
wait      - z   - Waits for one turn.
undo      - N/A - Undoes a mistaken action. I won't punish you for making a typo!
credits   - N/A - Shows a list of people involved with making the game!
